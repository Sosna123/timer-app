# Cubing Timer App

## What is it:
Cubing Timer App (name will change hopefully) is my attempt at making a timer for speedcubing. I'll try to make all of the necessary features like calculating averages, showing your best times etc. I'm making this app, because I like programming and I like speedcubing and I found a way to merge these two hobbies together, and it's an opportunity to make an another fun project to make me a better programmer and challenge myself.

## Functionality:
- Storing your times in a database, or cookies
- 2 modes of the timer: normal (with space), and input (type in your times)
- Generating scrambles for all of the WCA events
- A chart to help you visualize your progress
- It can also be used as a phone app (downloading it from the browser as a PWA)

## Shortcuts:
- ctrl + 2 => add a +2 to the last solve
- ctrl + 3 => add a DNF to the last solve
- ctrl + M => change the timer mode
